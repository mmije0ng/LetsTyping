    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are.
    Up above the world so high,
    Like a diamond in the sky.

    Baa, baa, black sheep,
    Have you any wool?
    Yes sir, yes sir,
    Three bags full.
    One for the master,
    One for the dame,
    And one for the little boy
    Who lives down the lane.

    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    And sorry I could not travel both
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    And looked down one as far as I could
    To where it bent in the undergrowth.
